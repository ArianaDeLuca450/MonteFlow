# MonteFlow
MonteFlow is a MATLAB-based solver for 2D steady-state heat transfer problems. It currently uses an iterative method to compute temperature fields and visualize the solution. The heatTransfer_MonteCarlo.m file runs a Monte Carlo simulation and visualizes data from the simulations. Currently, the stocastic boundary condition has Gaussian fluctuations.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the 'BilinearInterpolation.m' file in MATLAB.
3. Run the 'heatTransfer_MonteCarlo.m' file in MATLAB.

## Features
- Iterative solution for 2D steady-state heat transfer
- Visualizes results at each step
- Runs a Monte Carlo simulation on the heat transfer problem

  ## Planned Updates
  - Include Monte Carlo simulations for different types of stochastic boundary conditions
