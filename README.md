# MonteFlow
## A Monte Carlo Exploration of Boundary Uncertainty in Thermal Systems
MonteFlow is a MATLAB-based solver for 2D steady-state heat transfer problems. It currently uses an iterative method to compute temperature fields and visualize the solution. The heatTransfer_MonteCarlo.m file runs a Monte Carlo simulation and visualizes data from the simulations. The stochasticBoundaryCondition.m file is a function that allows you to choose from three SBC choices: Gaussian noise, bimodal noise, and Brownian motion.

## üöÄ Motivation
This project explores how stochastic boundary conditions (SBCs) affect steady-state heat diffusion. Inspired by the CFD Vision 2030 Vehicle Grand Challenge, the goal is to study how boundary-driven uncertainty propagates into interior temperature fields- offering insights into the kinds of variability that might arise in real-world aerospace systems.

## üîç Research Question
How do stochastic boundary conditions affect the statistical distribution of mean temperature and center point temperature in a steady-state diffusion problem?

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the 'BilinearInterpolation.m' file in MATLAB.
   - This code will allow you to visualize steady-state 2D heat transfer without SBCs.
3. Run the 'heatTransfer_MonteCarlo.m' file in MATLAB.
   - This code will perform Monte Carlo simulations with your chosen SBC.

## Features
- Iterative solution for 2D steady-state heat transfer
- Visualizes results at each step
- Runs a Monte Carlo simulation on the heat transfer problem
- Three available SCBs

## Next Steps
- Quantify the relationship between SBC variance and interior temperature variance
- Explicit time stepping
