# MonteFlow
MonteFlow is a MATLAB-based solver for 2D steady-state heat transfer problems. It currently uses an iterative method to compute temperature fields and visualize the solution. Future updates will feature Monte Carlo simulations that seek to quantify uncertainty from stochastic boundary conditions.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the 'BilinearInterpolation.m' file in MATLAB.

## Features
- Iterative solution for 2D steady-state heat transfer
- Visualizes results at each step

  ## Planned Updates
  - Include Monte Carlo simulations to analyze how stochastic boundary fluctuations influence heat transfer
  - Complete FFT analysis to analyze results
